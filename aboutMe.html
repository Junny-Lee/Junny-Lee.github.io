        <div id="aboutMe">
            Hi hello! I earned my Bachelor of Engineering from Dartmouth, majoring in Biomedical Engineering. 
            My background is very technical with a strong and constantly growing interest in software engineering. <br><br>
            After graduating, my first job was at Amazon Alexa, where I worked as a Knowledge Engineer. 
            The office that I worked out of in Santa Barbara was special because of its unique start-up culture. 
            There, I got to work on Alexa with all the resources that Amazon had to offer, but with a start-up culture due to the fact that the office was originally a start-up called Graphiq that got acquired by Amazon in 2017. 
            As a Knowledge Engineer, I got my hands on and analyzed a ton of customer data and took ownership of projects with the ultimate goal of earning customer trust and improving and retaining their daily interactions with their Alexa devices. <br><br>
            My time at Amazon has been extremely rewarding and I saw myself grow both professionally and personally. I enjoyed working towards our team/office-wide goals with my intelligent coworkers. 
            But, I realized that although I was fascinated by the technology I was working with, I wasnâ€™t satisfied with the breadth of what I got to do on the job. 
            I wanted more hands-on experience with coding and the ability to become more creative with it while constantly putting my problem-solving skills to test. 
            Shortly after wrapping up my year at Alexa, I decided to resign and enroll in an immersive coding bootcamp to pursue my interest in this field. <br><br>
            Now that my training as a full-stack software engineer is over, I am seeking a full-time position in software engineering or full-stack/front-end/back-end development with a dedicated team to provide quality products and services!
            I am thrilled for what is in store for me and excited to build, build, and build!<br><br>
