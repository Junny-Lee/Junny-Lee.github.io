            Hi, I'm Junny.<br><br>

            Currently looking for a full-time position in software engineering or full-stack / backend / frontend development, based in <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/24/fa314a/map-pin.png"/> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California">Santa Barbara</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Alumna of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College">Dartmouth College</a>.<br><br>

            I have a technical background and a constantly growing interest in software engineering. <br><br>

            My first job out of college was at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa">Amazon Alexa</a>, where I worked as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineer">Knowledge Engineer</a>. 
            I got to work on Alexa with all the resources that Amazon had to offer in a unique start-up culture. (The office in Santa Barbara that I worked out of was originally a start-up called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphiq">Graphiq</a> that got acquired by Amazon in 2017.)
            As a Knowledge Engineer, I analyzed a ton of customer data, taking ownership of projects with the ultimate goal of earning customer trust and improving and retaining their daily interactions with their Alexa devices. <br><br>
            My time at Amazon was been extremely rewarding as I grew both professionally and personally. But, I realized that although I was fascinated by the technology I was working with and the people I was surrounded by, I wasnâ€™t satisfied with the breadth of what I got to do on the job. 
            I wanted more hands-on experience with coding and the ability to become more creative with it while constantly putting my problem-solving skills to test. 
            Shortly after wrapping up my year at Alexa, I decided to resign and enroll in an immersive coding bootcamp to pursue my interest in this field. <br><br>

            My training as a full-stack software engineer is over,  and I am thrilled for what's in store for me. I am excited to build, build, and build!<br><br>

            Feel free to reach out via <a href="mailto:junny1997@gmail.com">
